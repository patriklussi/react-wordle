# Wordle clone

This project is my version of the game Wordle created by the NY Times. It was made with React.js and CSS. I was inspired to do this project after i saw the game and thought that it would be a good way to practice programming and react. 

The game contains about 400 words and each word put in by the user has to be a valid word. 
The game does not give you a score but still counts the amount of tries it takes for the user to guess the word. 
Once the user wins there is an opportunity to play again as many times as the user wants and there is also an info window if which explains the game if the user is confused or forgets how it works.

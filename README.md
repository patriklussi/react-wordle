# Wordle clone

This project is my version of the game Wordle created by the NY Times. It was made with React.js and CSS. I was inspired to do this project after i saw the game and thought that it would be a good way to practice programming and react. 

The game contains about 400 words and each word put in by the user has to be a valid word. 
The game does not give you a score but still counts the amount of tries it takes for you to guess the word.
